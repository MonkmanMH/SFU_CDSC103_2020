## Objectives

> The important thing is that you solve the problem that you’re working on, not write the most concise and elegant code (although that’s definitely something you want to strive towards!)
> - Grolemund & Wickham, _R for Data Science_


At the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:

1. Install and navigate R, RStudio, and tidyverse packages;

2. Import data from a variety of sources, and write output files;

3. Understand and apply data manipulation and modeling methods; 

4. Build and customize complex plots and reproducible reports from data in a data frame.
