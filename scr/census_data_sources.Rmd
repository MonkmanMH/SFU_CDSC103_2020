## Income by census tract


[Household Income Statistics (3) and Household Type Including Census Family Structure (11) for Private Households of Census Metropolitan Areas, Tracted Census Agglomerations and Census Tracts, 2016 Census - 100% Data](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=4&LANG=E&A=R&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=I&FREE=0&GC=001&GL=-1&GID=1241570&GK=10&GRP=1&O=D&PID=110193&PRID=10&PTYPE=109445&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=999&Temporal=2016&THEME=119&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=&D1=0&D2=0&D3=0&D4=0&D5=0&D6=0)


```{r}

df_98_400_X2016100 <- read_csv(here("data", "98-400-X2016100_ENG_CSV", "98-400-X2016100_English_CSV_data.csv"),
                               na = "x")

```


### data cleaning: {janitor} .

The data as provided is now functional, but we can make things easier to work with. As one example, the name of the "household type" variable has a lot of extra information. We can work with what's there, by putting back ticks around the name. Or we can rename the variables, both shortening them and removing spaces and other superfluous characters.

The {janitor} package gives us some tools to quickly clean up the variable names, among other useful tools. Here, we use the `clean_names()` function to put everything into lowercase and replace spaces with underscores.


```{r}

df_98_400_X2016100 <- clean_names(df_98_400_X2016100)

df_98_400_X2016100
```


#### rename()

We can also explicitly rename the variables in the data frame. We can do this using the `rename()` function in {dplyr}:


* See [Select/rename variables by name]](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html) at the {dplyr} reference pages



```{r}

df_98_400_X2016100 <- df_98_400_X2016100 %>%
  rename("household_type" = dim_household_type_including_census_family_structure_11,
         "household_type_cat" = member_id_household_type_including_census_family_structure_11,
         "household_type_cat2" = notes_household_type_including_census_family_structure_11,
         "households_total" = dim_household_income_statistics_3_member_id_1_total_household_income_statistics_note_3,
         "inc_median_total" = dim_household_income_statistics_3_member_id_2_median_total_income_of_households,
         "inc_median_after_tax" = dim_household_income_statistics_3_member_id_3_median_after_tax_income_of_households)

df_98_400_X2016100

```

Now the data frame is (somewhat) cleaner, we can continue our work.


## Filter by geography

First: filter by `geo_level`. In this case, "1" represents the CMAs and tracted CAs

To assign it to another data object that we can refer to later, use the assignment arrow `<-` (a keyboard shortcut is Alt+-).

```{r}

df_CMA <- df_98_400_X2016100 %>% 
  filter(geo_level == 1)

df_CMA

```



```{r}

df_CMA_after_tax <- df_CMA %>%
  filter(household_type == "Total - Household type including census family structure") %>% 
  select(geo_name, inc_median_after_tax) %>% 
  arrange(desc(inc_median_after_tax))

df_CMA_after_tax  

```


```{r}

ggplot(df_CMA_after_tax, aes(x = reorder(geo_name, inc_median_after_tax), y = inc_median_after_tax)) +
  coord_flip() +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = geo_name), yend = 0, colour = "grey50") +
  ylim(0, 150000) +
  theme_light()
  

```


## Census tract table

In this case, we will start again with the master table and use `filter()` to select the cases that are _not_ the CMAs, that is, where `geo_level` is not equal to 1.

Note that because we've already done all of the variable name cleaning, we don't have to repeat that step.


```{r}

df_CT <- df_98_400_X2016100 %>% 
  filter(geo_level != 1) 

df_CT

```


### Plot: histogram

```{r}

df_CT %>% 
  filter(household_type == "Total - Household type including census family structure") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = inc_median_after_tax)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 10000)

```



### Plot - density

```{r}

df_CT %>% 
  filter(household_type == "Total - Household type including census family structure") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = inc_median_after_tax)) +
    geom_density()

```



Or overlay two density curves:

```{r}

df_CT %>% 
  filter(household_type == "With children" | household_type == "With a female lone parent") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = inc_median_after_tax, colour = household_type)) +
    geom_density()

```
