# OUTCOMES

---

## Meta outcome 1: using **R**

Programming environment designed for statistical analysis / data science 

* Focus on one tool, so you get good at that


---


## Meta outcome 2: principles 

Concepts and practices that you can carry through to data analysis with other tools


---

## Learning outcomes:

At the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:

* Navigate R, RStudio, and tidyverse packages;

* Import data from a variety of sources, and write output files;

* Understand and apply data manipulation and modeling methods;

* Build and customize complex plots and reproducible reports from data in a data frame.


---

## RStudio Cloud

Web-based version of R & RStudio

## Reproducible workflow

> * Saves time,
> * Produces better science,
> * Creates more trusted research,
> * Reduces the risk of errors, and
> * Encourages collaboration.

Base R

* a data science / statistics programming language

* built-in analytic functions


---

Base R is like the engine and frame of a car & basic controls like the pedals and steering wheel

## packages

Packages extend the functionality of R

* statistical and data analysis

* data visualization

* data


---

...the packages are the other things that enhance the car's functions

* the body, windshield, headlights, A/C, sound system, etc

# Naming objects in R

Object names: 

* must start with a letter

* can only contain letters, numbers, `_`, and `.`

* _no spaces!_

Be descriptive!

---


## Three principles for (file) names

machine readable

human readable

plays well with default ordering

* from Jenny Bryan, ["How to name files"](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files)

### Naming files

Some other suggestions: 

* only use letters, numbers, `_`, and `.`

* _no spaces!_

# Dates

## ISO 8601

# Console

## R as calculator

Type in the console window:

`10 + 4`

--

What happened?


---

First create a new R notebook file

* File / New File > / R Notebook


---

# The power of named variables 

## the assignment arrow

`<-`

> "less than" plus hyphen


---

## assign the object "x" with the value 10

`x <- 10` 

--

> To show `x` in the console, just type `x`


---

> How would you create a new object "y" with the value 4?

--
`y <- 4`


> Now add x and y

--


`x + y`

--

> Did you notice the change in the Environment pane?


---

# How would you set `x` equal to 20?

--

`x <- 20`

--

# And now divide `x` by `y`

`x / y`

---

`t <- "If it's inside quotation marks, it's a character"`


Now print the object `t`


---

# Quick Detour
## functions for objects

|function |action |
| :--- | ---: |
| `ls()`    | *list objects*|
| `str()`    | *display structure of object*|
| `ls.str()`    | *list objects and their structure*|
| `names()`    | *display structure of object*|



---

## Vector -- a series of values

`x <- 1:10`

`x <- seq(1, 10)`

---

# `c` for concatenate

x <- c(1, 5, 6)

y <- c("British Columbia", "Alberta")



---

# Functions

`mean(x)`

# {tidyverse} -

"The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures."

The [{tidyverse} site](https://tidyverse.org): tidyverse.org

---

Two tidyerse data transformation packages we will be using today:

{dplyr} - data wrangling

{tidyr} - to pivot (spread and gather) data tables


---

## Loading a package

There are two steps to getting a package ready to use:

1. download and install

`install.packages()`

You don't need to do this -- our RStudio environment has all the packages you'll need!

2. load

`library()`

# Quick Detour
##getting help

In the console, typing a question mark (?) and a package or function brings up the Help info (bottom right pane)

Type the following:

`?mpg`

Or, once a package is loaded, it is accessible through the Help pane (bottom right) and will auto-fill once you start typing


---

# Quick Detour
## other sources of help

* `?package` or `?function`

* package page and vignettes

* cheat sheets

* Stack Overflow

* blogs
