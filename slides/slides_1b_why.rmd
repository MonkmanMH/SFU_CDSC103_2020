# OUTCOMES

---

## Meta outcome 1: using **R**

Programming environment designed for statistical analysis / data science 

* Focus on one tool, so you get good at that


---


## Meta outcome 2: principles 

Concepts and practices that you can carry through to data analysis with other tools


---

## Learning outcomes:

At the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:

* Navigate R, RStudio, and tidyverse packages;

* Import data from a variety of sources, and write output files;

* Understand and apply data manipulation and modeling methods;

* Build and customize complex plots and reproducible reports from data in a data frame.


---

## RStudio Cloud

Web-based version of R & RStudio

# Why code?

---

## Reproducible workflow

>Saves time,
>Produces better science,
>Creates more trusted research,
>Reduces the risk of errors, and
>Encourages collaboration.

Base R is like the engine and frame of a car & basic controls like the pedals and steering wheel


![VW Beetle frame](../img/VW_ad_1_crop.png)

---

...the packages are the other things that enhance the car's functions

* the body, windshield, headlights, A/C, sound system, etc

![VW Beetle transparent](../img/vwlooking.jpg)

...and RStudio is the dashboard and controls

# Naming objects in R

Object names: 

* must start with a letter

* can only contain letters, numbers, `_`, and `.`

* _no spaces!_

Be descriptive!

## Three principles for (file) names

machine readable

human readable

plays well with default ordering

* from Jenny Bryan, ["How to name files"](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files)

### Naming files

Some other suggestions: 

* only use letters, numbers, `_`, and `.`

* _no spaces!_

# Dates

## ISO 8601

YYYY-MM-DD

## Loading a package

There are two steps to getting a package ready to use:

1. download and install

`install.packages()`

Our RStudio environment has all the packages you'll need!

2. load

`library()`

##getting help

In the console, typing a question mark (?) and a package or function brings up the Help info (bottom right pane)

Type the following:

`?mpg`

Or, once a package is loaded, it is accessible through the Help pane (bottom right) and will auto-fill once you start typing
